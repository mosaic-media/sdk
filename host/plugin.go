// callbackBrokerID is the go-plugin broker stream the Platform serves its
// ContentService and Telemetry on, and the module dials for callbacks.
//
// It is a constant rather than an id negotiated per invocation, and that is a
// deliberate simplification worth explaining. go-plugin's broker multiplexes
// many streams over one connection, each identified by a number both ends agree
// on; the usual way to agree is to put the id in the request. That would mean a
// broker id field on every request that can call back.
//
// It is unnecessary here because the connection is not what scopes authority —
// the Caller handle is (platform#39). One long-lived callback connection per
// module process, with a handle minted and revoked per invocation, gives
// exactly the property the per-invocation design was reaching for: a retained
// connection is useless without a live handle, and a handle stops resolving the
// instant the invocation returns.
//
// There is one broker per plugin connection, so a fixed id cannot collide.

// SDKMajor is the SDK major version this harness speaks, and it is the whole

// they share an SDK major, so there is one number a user reasons about rather
// than two — the proto package version tracks it, and go-plugin's
// ProtocolVersion below carries it on the wire.
//
// While the SDK is pre-1.0 the compatibility unit is the minor version, which
// is effectively exact pinning. That is correct rather than unfortunate: Go
// gives v0.x no compatibility guarantee, and there are no third-party authors
// yet to inconvenience. Reaching SDK v1.0 is a precondition for a third-party
// ecosystem, not for building this tier.

// Handshake is go-plugin's mutual identification. It is not security — the
// magic cookie is compiled into both sides and public — it is what makes a
// process launched by mistake fail with a clear message instead of hanging on a
// protocol it does not speak.

// ProtocolVersion is the SDK major. Bumping it refuses every module built
// against the previous major, which is the intended behaviour: a major bump is
// where the contract broke.
