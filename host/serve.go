// Serve runs a module as a plugin process and blocks until the Platform

//
//	func main() { host.Serve(mymodule.New()) }

// Everything else the author wrote stays exactly as it was — the plain Go
// [v1.Capability], its provider roles, its tests with no transport at all. That
// property is what ADR 0064 is arranged around, and it is why moving a module
// between tiers is a build change rather than a rewrite.
//
// Serve does not return in normal operation. go-plugin writes the handshake to
// stdout, so a module must not print to stdout itself; anything written there
// corrupts the handshake. Use the [v1.Telemetry] reached from the context — that
// is what it is for, and it reaches the Platform's observability plane rather
// than a stream nobody is reading.
