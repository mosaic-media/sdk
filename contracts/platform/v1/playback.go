// The consumer surface (platform#25). Every role in provider.go is a *source*
// role: it brings content in and populates the virtual plane. This is the first
// role on the other side — one that acts on the materialised library rather
// than producing virtual results (platform#24's consumer capability, made
// concrete).
//
// The asymmetry that shapes it: a source role exchanges DTOs, but a consumer
// produces *bytes*, and bytes need a transport the SDK does not have and should
// not grow (platform#3 — the Platform owns transports; platform#15 — a module
// contributing a route would break the SDK-only boundary). So a provider
// resolves and never serves: it says where the bytes are, or undertakes to
// produce them, and the Platform hosts the origin either way.

// PlaybackKind discriminates how a resolution's bytes are reached. It is a
// closed set that grows deliberately: PlaybackServed (the module produces the
// bytes itself through an io.ReadSeekCloser the Platform serves) is the named
// next variant, for the torrent engine, and a transcoded variant is where
// transcoding would land. Neither exists yet, and neither is declared ahead of
// the slice that fills it.

// because nothing produces a Served resolution until the torrent engine does.
// Declaring it now would be surface with no consumer, which is the discipline
// platform#24 sets and module-stremio-addons#1 departed from only by explicit exception. The SDK
// is pre-1.0 precisely so the method can arrive with the slice that needs it.

// loaded the part, so a provider stays a pure function of what it is given and
// needs no graph read to do its job.
