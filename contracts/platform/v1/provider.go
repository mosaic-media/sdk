// The provider surface (ADR 0027). A module is not only an importer: a source
// exposes resources — metadata, search, catalogs, streams — and a module
// contributes them as typed provider roles the Platform inherits on enable and,
// by design, other modules resolve. Each role is a small interface a module
// implements only if it fills it, and declares in its Manifest.Provides.
//
// The read roles return the *virtual* content types below (SearchResult,
// CatalogItem, ContentMetadata) — transient projections, never object-graph
// nodes (ADR 0028). Only Import (see capability.go) writes nodes, and it does
// so from a ContentRef a read role produced. Nothing here takes a
// ContentService: reads do not write.

// Role names a provider role a module fills. It is the vocabulary of
// Manifest.Provides. A module declares the roles it implements; the Platform
// checks at composition that a declared role is backed by the matching
// interface below (a role named but not implemented is a composition-time
// error, not a runtime surprise), and resolves providers by role at runtime.
