// after materialisation. platform#45 recorded its absence as owed in as many
// words: "there is no command that updates a stored work's fields, so a
// re-import does not refresh its artwork today."
//
// Two things need it. The artwork enrichment pass (sdk#6) resolves art for a
// work the module already wrote, so it has a node and no way to put art on it.
// And a user choosing a different poster (platform#47) is an update to a node by
// definition — it is the feature platform#45 said storing artwork on the node was
// the precondition for.
//
// # It replaces, it does not merge
//
// The whole value is written, so a caller that wants to add candidates reads,
// merges and writes back. Merge semantics would have to decide what happens when
// two providers offer the same slot, and that decision belongs to whoever is
// assembling the set — not to a command that cannot see why it was called.
//
// This is the same shape as configureModule's replace semantics (platform#17), and
// it carries the same obligation: a caller that writes a partial value erases
// the rest. In particular, **a caller that re-resolves the flat slots will
// overwrite a user's chosen artwork**, so the selection feature will need to
// mark a choice as the user's before an automated pass can safely run again.
