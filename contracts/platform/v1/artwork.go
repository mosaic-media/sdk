package v1

// Artwork is the set of images shown for a content node — the poster on a card,
// the backdrop behind a hero, the logo used as a title treatment.
//
// It is stored on the node at materialisation rather than re-derived from the
// provider on every read (platform#45). That is what lets a list surface such as
// the continue-watching rail render from a single node read instead of a
// metadata round-trip per card, and what makes a node's art something a user can
// override — a choice possible only for artwork the library owns, not for a
// value re-derived on every view.
//
// # The flat slots are the selection; Candidates is what it was selected from
//
// The four flat fields hold one URL each and are what a renderer reads. They
// used to mean "the artwork the provider gave"; since platform#47 they mean "the
// artwork that was *chosen*", resolved once when the node is written.
// Candidates carries what it was chosen from — every image every source
// offered, with enough provenance to choose again differently.
//
// Keeping both is deliberate and is the whole shape of platform#47. A consumer
// never walks the candidate list to find out what to draw: there is exactly one
// answer to "what is this node's poster" and it is the field called Poster. The
// alternative — a list plus a selection index — would make every surface resolve
// the selection itself, and each would do it slightly differently.
//
// An empty field is "nothing was selected for this slot", which a renderer reads
// as "fall back", not as a blank image.
//
// The struct tags give the value a stable lower-case shape wherever it is
// serialised — the Platform stores it as a JSON document — so the storage form
// does not track Go's exported-field capitalisation. A document written before
// candidates existed decodes as a selection with nothing behind it, which is
// exactly what it was.
type Artwork struct {
	// Poster is portrait key art — the image a card shows. For an episode node
	// it is the episode still.
	Poster string `json:"poster,omitempty"`
	// Landscape is wide key art: the same title treated as a 16:9 card rather
	// than a portrait poster. It is distinct from Backdrop — a backdrop is
	// scenery to sit *behind* a hero, this is a composed card image to sit *in*
	// one, which is what a resume rail wants. Sources differ on whether they
	// have it: Cinemeta does not, an addon proxying a real artwork database
	// does, and it is empty rather than substituted when absent.
	Landscape string `json:"landscape,omitempty"`
	// Backdrop is landscape art shown behind a hero.
	Backdrop string `json:"backdrop,omitempty"`
	// Logo is the clearlogo / title-treatment image, rendered as a hero's title.
	Logo string `json:"logo,omitempty"`
	// Candidates is every image any source offered for this node, best-first
	// within each slot (platform#47).
	//
	// **Ordering is a write-time obligation, not a read-time one.** Whoever
	// assembles the set sorts it, so reading the best candidate for a slot is
	// taking the first one rather than re-running a policy on every render. That
	// is what keeps selection in one place and off the hot path.
	//
	// It holds slots the flat fields have no room for — a banner, clearart, disc
	// art — which is how the slot vocabulary grows without this struct growing a
	// field per art type and becoming a bag.
	Candidates []ArtworkCandidate `json:"candidates,omitempty"`

// ArtworkSlot names a kind of image — what the picture is *for*, not what it
// depicts. It is the axis a consumer selects on: a hero wants a backdrop, a card
// wants a poster, and the two are not interchangeable even for the same title.
//
// Open text with known values, like the media vocabularies (platform#11). A
// dedicated artwork source has types Mosaic has never heard of, and carrying an
// unrecognised one costs nothing while dropping it loses data a later Mosaic
// could use. A consumer that does not recognise a slot ignores it.
//
// Only the first four have a flat field on Artwork. The rest are reachable
// through Candidates, deliberately — see Artwork.Candidates.

	// candidates *within* a source; choosing between sources is a separate,
	// stated preference.
